Not using Caching for the Android SDK:
Installing the SDK takes less than 30sec but the compression of the 100k+ files of that SDK takes many minutes.
=> It's not worth the overhead of caching since GitHub Runner time is the main bottleneck to watch. 
See this discussion: https://chat.openai.com/share/4d72343c-e32c-40a4-8174-2a981ceaebe6

But in case I do want to reactivate Android SDK caching in the future, this was the code. 
The main thing that took figuring out was 'path' and 'key'.

      # Android SDK --------------
      
      - name: Cache Android SDK
        if: ${{ matrix.build_config }} == ${{ vars.RELEASE_CONFIG_NAME_ANDROID }}
        id: cache-android-sdk
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        env:
          cache-name: cache-android-sdk
        with:
          path: /usr/local/lib/android
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
          
      - name: Check cache-android-sdk hit
        if: steps.cache-android-sdk.outputs.cache-hit == 'true'
        run: echo "There was a cache-hit for restoring Android SDK."
