## Project Vision

We are building a comprehensive solution for the behind-the-scenes operations of large music festivals. I.e. a Vertical B2B SaaS. The most fundamental problem it solves: allowing thousands (!) of independent workers from dozens of sub-contractors across different trades (sanitary facility; cleaning; site-works; infrastructure; food & drinks etc. etc.) to know WHERE they need to go and WHAT they need to do there WHEN.

The ultimate vision is to build the 'digital twin' of all planning / operational / logistical / real-time aspects of music festivals (and in the future, possibly diversify into other types of temporary events on large venues). An interactive, custom-map will play an important role in the fulfilment of this vision.
